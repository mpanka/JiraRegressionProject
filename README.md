# JiraRegressionProject

In this project I used jenkins for cross-platform testing in Chrome and Firefox browsers
with the login part of my previous jira tests.

# Concepts Included:

Page Object pattern
Keyword driven testing
Commonly used test utility classes
Jenkins

Selenium Webdriver: Chrome and Chromedriver (UI tests use Chrome by default, can be changed in config)
Java
Maven

# Reporting
 
TestScript contains 5 tests, from which 5 passes.

After every commit tests will run in a remote server with jenkins.
